Jaynes currently supports:

1. [Importance sampling](is.md)
2. [Metropolis-Hastings](mh.md)
3. [Particle filtering](pf.md)
4. [Automatic differentiation variational inference](vi.md)

Many of these algorithms can be customized with custom proposals/kernels - allowing the user to engage in _programmable inference_.
