This is the documentation for the [Jaynes probabilistic programming system](https://github.com/femtomc/Jaynes.jl).

If you are familiar with probabilistic programming, you might start with [Modeling Language](modeling_lang.md), move into [Architecture](architecture.md), and then into the [execution contexts](library_api/contexts.md) or [inference](inference/is.md) sections in the library API reference.

If you're new to probabilistic programming, you might start with [Concepts](concepts.md), which provides some background about probabilistic programming, as well as some of the key conceptual ideas of this library.
