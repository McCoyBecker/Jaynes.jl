This is the documentation for the Jaynes probabilistic programming system.

If you are familiar with probabilistic programming, you might start with [Modeling Language](modeling_lang.md), move into [Architecture](architecture.md), and then into [execution contexts](contexts.md) in the library API reference.

If you're new to probabilistic programming, you might start with [Concepts](concepts.md).
