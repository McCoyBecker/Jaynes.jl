!!! info
    This library used to be called _Walkman.jl_ because the original implementation used a beautiful compiler metaprogramming packaged called [Cassette.jl](https://github.com/jrevels/Cassette.jl), hence the punny name and colored cartoon Walkman logo. The original logo artwork came from [an interesting article](https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/ode-to-the-walkman-in-memorium/Content?oid=2295035) about the late and great musical device.
