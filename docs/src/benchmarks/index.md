This page contains a set of benchmarks comparing Jaynes to other probabilistic programming systems. [The code for each of these benchmarks is available here.](https://github.com/femtomc/JaynesBenchmarks)

!!! warning
    Jaynes is currently in open alpha, which means that these benchmarks should not be taken seriously (any benchmarks between systems _must always_ be taken with a grain of salt anyways) until the system is fully tested.

    Furthermore, I'm not in the business of inflating the performance characteristics of systems I build. This means:

    1. If you notice that I'm not testing Jaynes against optimized programs in other systems, _please let me know_ so that I can perform accurate comparisons.
    2. If you suspect that there's an issue or bug with Jaynes, [please open an issue.](https://github.com/femtomc/Jaynes.jl/issues)
    3. If you'd like to perform a benchmark, also [please open an issue.](https://github.com/femtomc/Jaynes.jl/issues)

    Benchmarking is an inherently sensitive topic - I'd like to make these as fair and open as possible, so don't hesitate to reach out.
