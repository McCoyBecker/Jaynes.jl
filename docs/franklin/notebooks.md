Here are a number of notebooks which explore common models, modeling idioms, and usage of the inference library.

* [Bayesian linear regression (with HMC and AdvancedHMC inference)](../bayeslinreg)

* [Gaussian mixture models (with custom kernels and automatic differentiation variational inference)](../gmm)

* [Bayesian Lotka-Volterra (with AdvancedHMC inference)](../blotka)

* [Hidden Markov model with multi-variate transition and observation (with programmable particle filtering)](../hmm)
