This is heavily inspired by Gen.jl and Poirot.jl: a minimal trace-based PPL but including the usage of IR manipulations for the non-standard interpretation and analysis, which may help by providing information which can be used in inference programming.

This allows us to do cool things like:
1. Grab the dependency graph as a static pass and analyze it!
2. Possibly store meta-data for inference programming (i.e. exponential conjugacy).
3. Belief propagation and trace-based inference in one PPL like whaaaaaaaaaa

Work in progress :)
