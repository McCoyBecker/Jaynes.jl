This is a minimal trace-based PPL heavily inspired by Gen, but using IR manipulations for the non-standard interpretation and analysis.

This allows us to do cool things like:
1. Grab the dependency graph as a static pass and analyze it!
2. Possibly store meta-data for inference programming (i.e. exponential conjugacy).
3. Belief propagation and trace-based inference in one PPL like whaaaaaaaaaa

Work in progress :)
