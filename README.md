_Walkman_ is a minimal Cassette-based PPL.

Basing the system on metaprogramming and Cassette might allow us to do cool things like:
1. Grab the dependency graph of a probabilistic program as a static pass and analyze it!
2. Possibly store analysis meta-data for inference programming (i.e. sub-graphs with exponential conjugacy can be identified).
3. Belief propagation and trace-based inference in one PPL like whaaaaaaaaaa

Work in progress :)
